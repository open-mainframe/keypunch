Keypunch is a lightweight text editor designed to accelerate the ease of learning core IBM Mainframe languages like COBOL, PL/I, or z/Architecture Assembler by providing a dynamic hot reloading experience similar to Code School or Codecademy. Aspiring mainframe software engineers develop in an Ace 9 powered code editor, and by clicking a single easy button, Keypunch uses the `mainframe job` package to submit, retrieve, and render the output of their code alongside the code editor. By shortening the feedback loop, Keypunch hopes to accelerate the learning process of junior mainframe developers.

Because all client and Node.js logic is encapsulated in a single Electron app, Keypunch can run on corporate laptops behind the firewall. Because it uses `mainframe-job` to abstract away the details of interfacing with the mainframe's Job Entry Subsystem, Keypunch supports the long-tail of back-leveled z/OS systems. The goal is to help your developers learn to develop without a SysGen or other major impacts to your core business apps.

While this is a work in progress focused on delivering an initial MVP, this app offers a foundational platform that may be eventually enhanced to provide features such as:

* lessons for PL/1, COBOL, REXX, FORTRAN, HLASM, etc. that run entirely on the client app by parsing the JES output.
* enhancement to support z/VSE
* Use of socket.io to provide remote pair-programming for two corporate employees over the intranet.
* Gamification and Badges to encourage learning without compromising core business data.
